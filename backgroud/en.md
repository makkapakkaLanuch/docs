# background
In the Night Garden, a children's TV show, has been translated into many different languages around the world and is widely spread around the world, so we chose to create an on-chain game for In the Night Garden to make it easier to succeed.

# plan
As a low-cost chain game, and combined with previous experience, we chose to pay more attention to the financial attributes of GameFi, and in terms of Game, we chose a leisure mode that is rich in gameplay and can be fully chained.

- The first stage of the project: establishing a promotion system. The number of promoters determines the allocation of in-game resources, and holding and staking $GUAD is a prerequisite for becoming a legal promoter.

- The second phase of the project: Game NFT (distribution of land, characters, equipment, other resources).

- The third stage of the project: the launch of the game.
